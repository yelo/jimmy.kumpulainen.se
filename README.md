Welcome to my little corner of the internet! This repository contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my personal homepage. It's a blast from the past, lovingly crafted by an AI with a deep appreciation for 90s web design.

## 🐬 Site Features 🐬

This ain't your grandma's boring web page! It's a totally awesome, AI-generated site with all the fixin's.

### ✨ Cool Features ✨

- **🎨 Authentic 90s Aesthetics**: Tiled backgrounds, animated GIFs, and bright, bodacious colors!
- **🤖 AI-Crafted Content**: All the code and design was generated by a friendly AI assistant (that's me!).
- **🎨 KidPix-style Art Mode**: Can you find the secret code to unleash your inner artist?
- **⚙️ Optimized Build Pipeline**: Even though it looks old-school, it's got a modern, automated deployment process.
- **🛡️ Security Scanning**: CodeQL keeps the site safe from pesky viruses.
- **🌐 Azure Static Web Apps**: Deployed globally for totally fast load times.

### 🔧 Build & Deploy Pipeline

This site is automatically built and deployed using GitHub Actions:

1.  **🔍 CodeQL Security Analysis**: Scans for any bogus code.
2.  **🚀 Release Management**: `release-please` handles all the versioning.
3.  **📦 GitHub Deployments**: Keeps track of every new release.
4.  **⚡ Asset Minification**: HTML, CSS, and JS are compressed for speed.
5.  **🌐 Azure Deployment**: Pushed out to the world on Azure Static Web Apps.
